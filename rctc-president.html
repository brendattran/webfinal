			<p>It's good to be the president.</p>

			<p>Most of the time.</p>

			<p>On Tuesday, Rochester Community and Technical College student Sofia Alston settled behind the big desk to sample life as an RCTC president. At the same time, RCTC interim president Mary Davenport was reliving her student days. She was in a modern dance class, using muscles she hadn't used in years.</p>

			<p>"That was hard," Davenport said later.</p>

			<p>There's an adage: Never judge people until you've walked a mile in their shoes. On Tuesday, Davenport and Alston exchanged shoes, as Alston, 21, became the RCTC president and Davenport, 59, became the student.</p>

			<p>Alston, the RCTC Student Senate president, signed contracts and authorization forms. She roamed the hallways, walkie-talkie in hand, corralling students out of buildings during a fire drill. She sat at the head of a cabinet meeting of senior RCTC officials.</p>

			<p class="pull-quote">"I was explaining (to someone) how she can be a human being, there's so much to do," Alston said.</p>

			<p>Such role playing can come across as gimmicky, but Alston said the exercise offered insights she had not imagined before her president-for-a-day experience. It awakened her to the balancing act of leadership -- how easy it can be to lose sight of the individual student when faced with the responsibility of managing a 12,000 student institution.</p>

			<p>"I was explaining (to someone) how she can be a human being, there's so much to do," Alston said.</p>

			<p>For Davenport, the experience wasn't such a stretch for a person who once had been a student. But there's nothing like seeing student life at the ground level to get a different perspective.</p>

			<p>At a student meeting about the RCTC food bank, which serves low-income students, Davenport learned some needy students who could benefit from the service weren't using it.</p>

			<p>"We're not reaching the students. There's a lot of students we're missing," Davenport said. "How do we better communicate the services that we have here?"</p>

			<p>Alston said she hopes the exercise makes RCTC students more comfortable in approaching administration.</p>

			<p>"I always tell students that she's a really awesome person, but just taking that step and taking the initiative to actually talk with her, that's what I'm really hoping for," Alston said.</p>

			<p>Davenport said she hopes Alston's moment in the executive spotlight convinces her to consider becoming a college president. There is a nationwide shortage of college presidents. RCTC has yet to hire a long-term president nearly four years after the last one, Don Supalla, retired at the end of the 2012-13 academic year.</p>

			<p>Asked if she ever would consider the possibility, Alston said she might.</p>

			<p>"I would have never thought of administration. I get to see something different that I would have never expected going into," Alston said. "I would definitely consider it."</p>
