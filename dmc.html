				<h2>DESTINATION MEDICAL CENTER</h2>
				<h1>TRANSFORMING ROCHESTER</h1>
				<span></span>
				A Post Bulletin special report

			<div id="special-report-line"></div>
			<div id="special-report-description">
				<p>Last year was a big one for DMC. This year will be bigger. Much bigger. Already in the pipeline in Rochester alone are projects worth more than a half-billion dollars. Think about that for a second.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div id="special-report-container2">
			<p>And that’s just private development. This month, Mayo Clinic announced plans for $214 million in new investments at Saint Marys Hospital, on top of the hundreds of millions the clinic already has invested in the hospital during the past few years. The plan includes adding three floors to the Generose Building, increasing the number of private rooms, improving the cardiovascular, neo-natal and pediatric intensive care units and more.</p>

			<p class="pull-quote">Will this be the year people begin to believe Destination Medical Center really will transform Rochester and the region?</p>

			<p>Yes. From the big hole across the street from the PB where the about $124 million Hilton project is well underway to the construction later this year of the first of what will be many R&D buildings in Discovery Square, we’ll see tangible, irrefutable evidence of the work that’s been done for the past four years on DMC.</p>

			<p>When that happens, you can say DMC genuinely is underway. Everything that has happened to date has been prepping the patient for a procedure. There’s been a lot of expensive prep work, and local taxpayers have spent millions on it, as have Mayo and private developers. But this year, the procedure begins, with the PICC line inserted and up to $585 million in public money over 20 years flowing into Rochester to support the projected $6 billion Mayo and that other investors are expected to spend.</p>

			<p>As the patient in this procedure, Rochester is understandably a bit nervous. There’s been a long buildup, a lot of hurry up-and-wait, too much song and dance, too many experts and consultants and a pile of bills coming due, with expensive premiums and high deductibles.</p>

			<p>But there’s a reason why people who are in for treatment are called patients — it takes a lot of that virtue to put up with the tests and preparation, the procedure itself and then the outcome, which might or might not be what we expected.</p>

			<p class="pull-quote">Well, the wait is over. The procedure is about to begin.</p>

			<p>Even after four years of DMC, a lot of people in Rochester and the region don’t really get what it is. They know it involves Mayo — everything in Rochester and the area involves Mayo — and it involves tax money, but that’s about it. That’s understandable — there’s nothing else similar to it in Minnesota, and it’s hard to find a relatively close analogy anywhere. We’re unique.</p>

		<div id="dmc-drawing">
			<div id="dmc-drawing-quote"><p class="pull-quote2">DMC isn’t a project.<br> It’s a 20-year economic development initiative.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div id="special-report-container4">
			<p>DMC isn’t a one-and-done thing. To repeat, it’s a 20-year initiative, and for those of you who are younger than me, don’t be surprised if 19 years from now, the next generation of Mayo Clinic administrators, business leaders and legislators are talking about an extension.</p>
			
			<p>That would be a good thing. That would mean DMC worked.</p>

			<p>It’s not a program. Programs are — well, programmatic. They’re generally top-down, well-defined efforts with a fairly narrow mission and a budget that might or might not be met. Some of that might ring true of DMC, but it’s not a program. As journalists, we’ve had a hard time settling on a term, but “initiative” is where we ended up for the most accuracy. DMC was initiated by Mayo Clinic, it gathered power with city, county and business leaders climbing on board, and it relatively quickly won the approval of legislators and the governor in 2013.</p>

			<p class="pull-quote">The rest is history, and now we’re making it.</p>

			<p>DMC is an economic development initiative to leverage the on-going and truly astounding growth of Mayo Clinic for more private development — medical and nonmedical — in the city, with tax money tagged for improving and expanding the city’s infrastructure to accommodate the growth.</p>

			<p>It’s a collaboration. All three things have to happen — Mayo’s continued investment in Rochester, greatly expanded investment in Rochester by private interests, and the flow of public money — if DMC is going to live up to all the hype. </p>

			<p>Some do call DMC a lot of hype, a hustle, a pipedream, a plan for the rich to get richer, and DMC certainly is about marketing the clinic and city. But there’s no doubt Mayo will continue to make gigantic investments in Rochester for the foreseeable future. There’s no doubt developers such as Alatus, Opus and Titan think it’s a market worth the investment. Local, area and state government is committed to making it work.</p>

			<p>As a result, this likely will be the year when people say: Whatever DMC is, it’s definitely happening now. You couldn’t see it before, but now you can.</p>

			<p>It also could be the year when others around the state say: Can we get a DMC?</p>
